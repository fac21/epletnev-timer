:satisfied:This week's project: a “Pomodoro timer”. This is a productivity tool that helps you time alternating periods of working and resting.:satisfied:

Features implemented:
- [x] _A “work” timer that counts down to zero (usually 25 minutes)_
- [x] _A second “break” timer that counts down to zero (usually 5 minutes)_
- [x] _Buttons to start a session, pause the timer, or cancel the session and restart_

Stretch goals
- [x] _Customisable lengths of time for work/break_
- [x] _Play an alarm sound to make it obvious the time is up_
